# Ethereum Wallet Transactions

This project allows users to fetch Ethereum wallet transactions, including ERC-20 token transfers, and check the balance of an address on a specific date using the Etherscan API.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Flask
- Requests
- Python-dotenv

## Setup

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required Python packages by running:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt

3. Create a `.env` file in the root directory with the following content:

    ```ini
